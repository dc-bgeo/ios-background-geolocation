# BGeo Engine — Proprietary License

The open-source part of this repository (the bridge/facade sources) is licensed
under the MIT License — see [`LICENSE`](./LICENSE).

This file governs the **closed-source engine binaries** bundled with or pulled
in by this repository. They are NOT covered by the MIT grant: the bridge on its
own does not function without them.

Copyright (c) 2026 BGeo. All rights reserved.

This Part governs the closed-source engine binary
`Frameworks/BGeoCore.xcframework` (the "Engine"), however obtained — from this
repository, from a Swift package checkout, or as part of another BGeo SDK
package.

### 1. Grant

Subject to a valid, current license key issued by BGeo and to these terms, BGeo
grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable license to install and use the
Engine in applications you develop and distribute.

- **Development / evaluation.** Debuggable builds and the iOS Simulator run
  without a license key.
- **Production.** A release build requires a valid license key bound to your
  bundle identifier and Team ID. Without one, the SDK refuses to start and
  throws a `LICENSE_*` error.

A license key is valid for one year. Applications built with an SDK version
released during your license term keep working after the term ends; renewing
grants access to SDK versions released after it.

### 2. Restrictions

You may NOT: (a) decompile, disassemble, reverse-engineer, or otherwise attempt
to derive the source of the Engine; (b) redistribute, sublicense, rent, or
resell the Engine except as embedded in your own applications; (c) remove or circumvent the license mechanism or any binding to your
application; (d) share
a license key across applications not covered by it.

### 3. No Warranty

THE ENGINE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED. BGEO IS NOT LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES, OR OTHER LIABILITY ARISING
FROM ITS USE.

### 4. Termination

This Part terminates automatically if you breach its terms. On termination you
must stop using and distributing the Engine. The MIT grant in `LICENSE` is
unaffected.
