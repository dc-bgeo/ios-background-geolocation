//
// Swift port of `react-native/example/src/geofences.ts`; `flutter/example/lib/
// src/geofences.dart` is the same port for Flutter. `geofences.ts` itself is
// only `syncGeofences()` (this file's `refresh()`) — `add`/`remove` are
// inlined in `GeofenceFormScreen.tsx`'s `onSave`/`onDelete` (SDK call, then
// `await syncGeofences()`, both wrapped in try/catch so a failed SDK call
// never reaches the sync step). `removeAll` has no reference-app call site at
// all (neither RN nor Flutter wires a "clear all" action anywhere), but this
// task's brief names it explicitly as part of `Geofences`'s interface and the
// SDK already exposes `removeGeofences()` — added for that reason, following
// the exact same call-then-sync shape as `add`/`remove` rather than inventing
// a different one.
//
// `add`/`remove`/`removeAll` are all `async throws`, mirroring the try/catch
// RN wraps around every one of these calls (even `removeGeofence`, whose iOS
// facade never actually throws) — see the interior comment on the `Call`
// typealiases below for why the closure seam keeps that shape all the way
// through the test surface.
